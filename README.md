### Project Description

### This project focuses on the digital recreation of the Apple iPhone logo using several computer graphics methods. The main objective was to explore how different graphic techniques affect visual quality, scalability, and usability in digital media. By applying multiple approaches, the project demonstrates how the same logo can be represented in various graphical forms.

### Vector and Raster Graphics Implementation
One version of the logo was produced using vector graphics, allowing the image to remain sharp and clear at any size. This makes vector formats especially suitable for responsive web design and high-resolution displays.

In contrast, a raster version of the logo was created using a pixel-based format. While this format is widely supported and easy to use on screens, it is limited in terms of scaling, as image quality decreases when enlarged.

### Bézier Curve Construction
Another variation of the logo was designed using Bézier curves. This method relies on mathematical curve definitions controlled by anchor points, enabling smooth edges and precise shape control. Bézier curves are commonly used in professional graphic design software and are ideal for creating clean and accurate logo shapes.

### Selection of the Logo
The Apple iPhone logo was chosen due to its iconic status and minimalist design. Its simple geometry and recognizable silhouette make it an excellent example for testing and comparing different graphic techniques while maintaining visual consistency across formats.
### Web Usage Demonstration
All logo versions were integrated into a website to demonstrate their behavior in a real digital environment. This step highlights how different graphic formats perform across devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions, emphasizing the importance of choosing the appropriate format for web presentation.
